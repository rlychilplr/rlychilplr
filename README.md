### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sander but online i usually go by rlychilplr

 - I'm currently a student at Techniek College Rotterdam
   - the first year i was tought: html, css, js, php, mysql and wordpress
   - for my first elective part I chose to delve into docker
   - the second year consists of delving deeper into the above mentioned languages, primairily php and js
     - I was also tought more about certain best practices (working in classes, using certain development patterns, MVC the manual way, etc)
   - my second elective is micro-controllers, which comes down to working with arduinos and C++
